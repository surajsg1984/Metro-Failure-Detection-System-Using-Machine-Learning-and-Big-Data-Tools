# Metro-Failure-Detection-System-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Big-Data-Tools
The Metro Failure Detection System is a predictive maintenance solution that uses ML and big data to detect and prevent failures in metro componentsâ€”especially air compressors. Using the MetroPT-3 dataset, it analyzes sensor data to identify anomalies, forecast issues, enhance safety, and reduce downtime and costs.
